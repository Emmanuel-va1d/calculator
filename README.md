# calculator

In this program, I will create a functioning calculator

the functionality will be created in the script file, while the user interface will be touched on the markup files

The calculator should have functions for adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing.

There should be buttons meant for entering and clearing the workspace

As of now, the keys for the calculator are:
BTN     Keys
0-9:    0-9
+:      +
-:      -
x:      *
÷:      /
=:      Enter or =
Del:    Backspace or Delete
AC:     c
HIS:    h
±:      s
.:      .
%:      %
√:      _
